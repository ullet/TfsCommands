# TfsCommands

Simple Windows PowerShell wrapper functions to tf.exe   
NB. Just simple functions, no nice PowerShell objects nor pipeline friendly.

## Why?
This module exists because I wanted a slightly more PowerShell-like way of working with the TFS command line.   
Also [Team Foundation Server Power Tools](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f017b10c-02b4-4d6d-9845-58a06545627f)
does not provide Cmdlets for creating or deleting workspaces, workfolder mappings or cloaked folders (and to be honest I didn't know about the Power Tools Cmdlets when I wrote the first version of this module, so it's really just luck that there's very little overlap). 

## How to install
1. Install dependencies:
  1. Install [GeneralCommands](//github.com/ullet/GeneralCommands) PowerShell module.
2. Download [master.zip](//github.com/ullet/TfsCommands/archive/master.zip) for this repository
3. Extract the contents of the zip file to a new folder named "TfsCommands" inside your
   WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder.

## How to use

```PowerShell
Import-Module TfsCommands
